				<p>Allow <strong>15-20 minutes</strong> to complete the card sort.</p>
				<p class="font-large"><strong>Step 1 – Sort each value</strong></p>
				<p>
					Drag and drop each one of the <strong>24 career values</strong> from the 
					left hand list to one of the five columns, according to <strong>how 
					important</strong> each value is for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is <strong>no limit</strong> on how many cards you can place in any 
					one column. However we recommend that you try to place <strong>some values 
					in each column</strong> – this will help you to decide what really is most 
					and least important to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					We understand that it can sometimes be difficult to decide exactly where to 
					place each card and suggest you place it in the <strong>'best fit'</strong> 
					column. You can change their order and column <strong>as many times</strong> 
					as you like.
				</p>
				<p class="font-large"><strong>Step 2 – Review and prioritise your values</strong></p>
				<p>
					Once you have completed the sort, check to see that you have placed each value 
					in <strong>priority order</strong> from top to bottom in each column.
				</p>
				<p class="font-large"><strong>Step 3 – Click next to view and print results</strong></p>
				<p>
					Once you click next you will see your results displayed. Click on the BACK button 
					if they don't seem right and you want to change them around. You will also see a 
					series of questions designed to help you <strong>make further sense</strong> of 
					your career values.
